          Visakhapatnam (also known as Vizag, Viśākha or Wāltair)[6] is the largest city in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, serving as headquarters of the Visakhapatnam district.[7] It lies between the Eastern Ghats and the coast of the Bay of Bengal.[8] The city is set to become the executive capital of Andhra Pradesh once a decentralization bill is enacted the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly.[9] It is one of the four smart cities of Andhra Pradesh selected under Smart Cities Mission.

        <blockquote>vizag is the city of my dreams: Modernity and tradition are fusing together and constantly give birth to new creations of light and shadow. It is true that the city never sleeps. The LightHouse are flickerung 24/7 and bathing the city in its signature glow and giving me life.</blockquote>
